Welcome to The Auction House

It's a simple game where you can run around and view / purchase items that are live on the marketplace.

As you can i've implemented a slight variation of the prefab that gets the NFTS from the chainsafe marketplace and displays them. Thank you for being such an awesome company. We love your SDK!
